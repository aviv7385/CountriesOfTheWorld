# CountriesOfTheWorld
An excersize for my Fullstack Web Developement course at John Bryce college.

To see a table of all countries in the world - click on the "Display All Countries" button. In the table that will be displayed you will see information about each country. The information will include:

* The Name of the country
* The name of its capital city
* The currencies used in this country
* The continental borders this country has (with other countries - unless it's an island)
* The top level domain of this country
* A picture of the country's flag
There is also the possibility to search for a specific country - just type the name of the country in the search box. In case you don't type the whole name - the program will search for all the countries that have those letters in their names, and will display their information. For example, if you type the word "united" in the search box you will get information on all the countries which have "united" in their names (e.g. United States, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom etc...).

The Technologies I used:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Java Script
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
